## BitCaine5 Aeternity Multi CPU GPU Miner
BitCaine5 the mining engine meets Ã¦ternity blockchain technology

have found a solution for multi multi cpu gpu mining!!!

## How does it work?
More next week, will talk to the devs on Monday

## Examples

COMPUTING      | AE NODES      | PRICE         | WORKS  | TESTED | OS     | LICENSING 
-------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | -------
CPU  1 to  50  | ONE           | free          | YES    | YES    | LINUX  | GPL & PAID
GPU  1 to  50  | ONE           | free          | YES    | NO     | LINUX  | GPL & PAID
MIX  1 to  50  | TWO           | free          | YES    | NO     | LINUX  | GPL & PAID
CPU 50 to 100  | ONE           | need support  | YES    | NO     | LINUX  | GPL & PAID
GPU 50 to 100  | ONE           | need support  | YES    | NO     | LINUX  | GPL & PAID
MIX 50 to 100  | TWO           | need support  | YES    | NO     | LINUX  | GPL & PAID
+50 x CPU/GPU  | +1            | need support  | YES    | NO     | LINUX  | GPL & PAID
+50 x MIX      | +2            | need support  | YES    | NO     | LINUX  | GPL & PAID

**as faster your server and as faster your network as less physical servers you need**

### You have 1 to a million cPUs
* it will work !
* you need x nodes(see table 2) to manage them all, there a several solutions to run more 
than one EPOCH instance on one physical machine

### You have 1 to a million gPUs
* it will work !
* you need x nodes(see table 2) to manage them all, there a several solutions to run more 
than one EPOCH instance on one physical machine

 
---

### You will run a hole farm with a million CPUs and GPUs
* it will work !
* it depends how fast your servers and network are, test it you self and share you results

## How long does it take to setup
* less then a minute
* and +- one hour
* I will publish the scripts later

## Community Edition and paid Version
* full source code control

## Do I have to install any BitCain binary?
* **Yes! You have to build it always your self!!!**

## Why will I pay for the software if I can get for free?
* because I need your support to develop and you are not an idiot
* No support No software
